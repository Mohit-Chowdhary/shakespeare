#Shakespearean Insult Generator (Python + Tkinter)

funny little roaster

little fireworks and mr shakespere himself bouncing(shaking) around

A ridiculous but surprisingly educational desktop app that throws random Shakespearean insults at you, complete with a floating bard and chaotic fireworks.

What It Does
Displays a GUI with:

A button that generates insults like:
"Thou warped beetle-headed ratsbane!"

A floating Shakespeare image bouncing around the window

Fireworks that randomly explode on the screen

What I Learned
Building GUI animations using tkinter.Canvas and .after()

Using PIL (Image, ImageTk) to handle image resizing and transparency

Organizing a self-contained GUI app in Python

Exporting a Python app to a standalone .exe using PyInstaller

Handling bundled images with sys._MEIPASS

Understanding the real-world file size and packaging quirks of Python GUIs
(final build size wasn’t huge, but definitely bigger than expected)

Why I Made This
It started as a joke project — but ended up teaching me how Python GUIs work under the hood, how animations run on a canvas, and what it takes to bundle everything into a runnable Windows .exe.

Not meant to be serious. But it works, and it's funny. That’s enough.
